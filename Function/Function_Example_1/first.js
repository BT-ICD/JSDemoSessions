/**
 * Function scope and conflicts
 * Both functions you want to call are called greeting(), but you can only ever access the first.js file's greeting() function
 * (the second one is ignored). In addition, an error results when attempting (in the second.js file) 
 * to assign a new value to the name variable â€” because it was already declared with const, and so can't be reassigned.
 * 
 *  Keeping parts of your code locked away in functions avoids such problems, and is considered the best practice.
