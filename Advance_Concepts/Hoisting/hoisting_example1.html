                JavaScript enables you to have multiple var statements anywhere in a function, and
                they all act as if the variables were declared at the top of the function. <span class="text-primary"> This behavior is
                known as hoisting. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                This can lead to logical errors when you use a variable and then you
                declare it further in the function. For JavaScript, as long as a variable is in the same
                scope (same function), it’s considered declared, even when it’s used before the var
                declaration.
